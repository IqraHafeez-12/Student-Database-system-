**Student Database System using Binary Search Tree (BST) Project**
**Overview**
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching for nodes. The project includes a self-balancing AVL tree to ensure that the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions, providing efficient performance for these operations.

**Features**
Insert nodes into the BST
Delete nodes from the BST
Search for nodes in the BST
Maintain balanced tree structure using AVL tree properties
**Setup**
To set up this project, you need a C++ development environment. You can use any C++ compiler such as GCC, Clang, or an IDE like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

**Prerequisites**
A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
Basic understanding of C++ and data structures
